# TidyGenePlot

scRNA-seq analysis processed with the R package Seurat usually takes violin plots and feature plots to detect the expression pattern/levels of various genes. However, the violin plots generated by the function Vln() were often annoyed by
the element "Identify" and the legend on the plot;  as well as the feature plots annoyed by coordinates. To solve this problem, we developed the R package TidyGenePlot to generate tidy and clean violin plots and feature plots by removing those annoyed elements/factors, to give researchers a tidy and clean output.
